# Pirate_Player Version.1
Play Pirated Audiobooks with the convenience of Auto bookmarking feature. Created as a minimilist "Audible clone", The convenience of Audible without having to purchase audiobooks and being able to play pirated audiobooks on your laptop or computer. Thus mitigates the need for Audible as the main USP for Audible is the convenience of the AutoBookmarking feature and continuing where you left off, whereas if you just used a regular audio player, you will have to manually keep track of the last timestamp, which is inconvenient ,especially if you listen to Audiobooks when going to sleep.

# Use-case
I created this to listen to my pirated audiobooks when going to sleep,I enter the time I wish the audiobook to play for,and once the duration is up, the player will auto-bookmark the last position of the audiobook and quits, allowing you to then continue where you left off, the next time you listen to the audiobook.

I have created a bash script which runs the player and once the player exits, runs my alarm-clock program which suspends my laptop until it's time to wake me up with my personal alarm.With my laptop Which is by my bedside. Having a laptop by my bedside instead of a mobile,helps eliminate distractions and blue light and makes sure I go to sleep early.
